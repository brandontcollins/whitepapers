## Overview

This whitepaper provides a practical, end-to-end guide to securing modern macOS systems. It covers password and passphrase strategy, passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn), hardware security keys, FileVault and encrypted containers, and a resilient macOS update and patch-management approach tailored to different threat models.

The goal is to give developers and security-conscious users a concrete, actionable reference for hardening macOS endpoints without resorting to vendor-specific products.
